# ExCYT

## A Graphical User Interface for streamlining analysis of high-dimensional cytometry data

ExCYT is a MATLAB-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to analyze their flow cytometry data 
via commonly employed analytical techniques for high-dimensional data including dimensionality reduction via t-SNE,
a variety of automated and manual clustering methods, heatmaps, and novel high-dimensional flow plots.
